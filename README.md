LiveBoard
=========

LiveBoard was born as final project of my undergraduate degree. It is a synchronised drawing board.

Basically the idea is that when you draw something on your screen, the others who are in the same e-room will see the change. It can be used as a tool in conference.

You can register a user, establish a room and wait for others come. When they arrive, the e-conference will start.
